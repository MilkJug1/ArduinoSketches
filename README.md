  Special Thanks to Fundroid 3000 that created the app that drives the program
  Find the App in the playstore --> Arduino Bluetooth controller  by Funduino
  This sketch uses the default setting from the App.
  The arrow buttons are direction, the shapes buttons are speeds
  The Function buttons determine the speed. Uppercase"A" is slowest and "H" is fastest
  Speed determines the magnitude of the motors 0 = off, 255 = full speed
  The left and right keys use an offset "offset1" to slow one of the motors so the robot veers
  in the direction of the slower motor.
  As speed is changed, so is the offset. The default is set as a percentage of speed.
  It is set at one third of the speed setting. This is easily changed
  This is a major area for experimentation.
